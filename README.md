#### Netlify

Netlify hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and single workflow deployment pipeline (deploys from GitHub). [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)

#### React.js

Interactive, component-driven UI created with React JavaScript library. [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)

#### Responsive, Dynamic Design

Application built for multi-device compatibility. UI/UX goes beyond a mobile-first approach to ensure content is presented well on a variety of device/window/screen sizes, ensuring usability and satisfaction.

#### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Conventional CSS style sheets chosen for styling due to the simplicity and size of the application. Create-React-App Webpack setup makes CSS style sheets a convient feature. CSS files are concatenated into a single minified .css file in build output during production. [create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet)
